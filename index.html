                    Downey was born in Manhattan, New York, the younger of two children. His father, Robert Downey Sr.,
                    is
                    an actor and
                    filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann, was an actress who appeared in Downey Sr.'s films. Robert's
                    original family name
                    was Elias which was changed by his father to enlist in the Army. As a child, Downey was "surrounded
                    by
                    drugs." His
                    father, a drug addict, allowed Downey to use marijuana at age six, an incident which his father
                    later
                    said he
                    regretted.Downey later stated that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his
                    father:During
                    his childhood,
                    Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut at the age of five, playing a
                    sick puppy in the
                    absurdist comedy Pound (1970), and then at seven appeared in the surrealist Greaser's Palace (1972)
                    In
                    May 1992, he
                    married actress Deborah Falconer. Two years later, the couple had a son, Indio, naming friend and
                    actor,
                    Anthony Michael
                    Hall, as the boy's godfather.</p>
                <p>
                    Downey’s ‘Chaplin (1992) is one of his biggest achievements until now. Richard Attenborough, the
                    director of the movie,
                    got him trained in many aspects that were necessary for a true portrayal of Chaplin, like, learning
                    how
                    to play violin,
                    etc.

                    Joining the cast of American television mini-series ‘Ally McBeal’, after serving his time in the
                    prison, in 2000,
                    was a
                    great professional move from Downey’s side. He won many accolades for his role in the series.
